# Machine Learning Model Optimization with Hyperparameter Tuning Approach

## Project Overview

This project explores the importance of hyperparameter tuning in machine learning model optimization. It provides a comprehensive comparison between grid search and random search as tuning techniques. It also examines supervised learning models (Ridge and Lasso regression) and unsupervised learning models (K-Means and DBSCAN) to highlight the impact of hyperparameter optimization.

The study includes:
- Implementation of grid search and random search.
- Supervised learning models (Ridge and Lasso regression) with alpha parameter tuning.
- Unsupervised learning models (K-Means and DBSCAN) with hyperparameter tuning.
- Performance evaluation before and after tuning.

## Justification for Dataset Choice

The datasets used in this study were generated using Scikit-Learn’s make_regression and make_blobs functions:

1. Supervised Learning (Regression Models: Ridge & Lasso Regression)
   - The make_regression dataset was chosen because:
     - It allows control over noise levels, feature distributions, and dataset size.
     - It ensures a clear linear relationship, making it suitable for demonstrating regularization in Ridge and Lasso regression.

2. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering Models: K-Means & DBSCAN)
   - The make_blobs dataset was selected due to:
     - Its ability to generate well-separated clusters, aiding in evaluating clustering performance.
     - The absence of real-world noise, allowing a controlled environment for analysis.

## Tutorial Format

The tutorial is structured as follows:
1. Introduction to Hyperparameter Tuning – Explanation of its significance and challenges.
